# OW GRID
***
**OW GRID** is a CSS3 flex based grid system. It's developed thinking about modern web application and its first purpose is to make easier to manage responsive layout. It's developed in SASS but you can use a compiled version if you prefear. 

<br/>

## Installation
For now you can pull the repo or download it via GitHub options. NPM and Bower options will come soon.

<br/>
## Options
If you are using the SASS version you can personalize those variables, simply changing the value before importing our `main.sass`.

### $use-flex
default: `true` - type: `boolean` 

**OW GRID** is developed with CSS3 Flexbox, but we also provide an untested version in float. 
Set this option to `false`, to use it.

### $rem-base
default: `16px` - type: `unit`  

This is the default font-size value for `html`. We use this value not only to set the base font-size of our application, but also as default value for **units functions**

### $row-width
default: `rem-calc(1920)` - type: `unit` 

This is the `max-width` of our row objects. The dafault value is 1920 pixels we translate it in rems via **rem-calc units functions**

### $column-gutter
default: `rem-calc(30)` - type: `unit` 

This is the space between our column. The dafault value is 30 pixels we translate it in rems via **rem-calc units functions**

### $grid-columns
default: `12` - type: `number` 

The number of columns we will use in our layout.

### $use-classes
default: `false` - type: `boolean` 

Set this variable to true if you want to generate static classes, like: `.row`, `.column` or `large-12`. 

### $row-name
default: `row` - type: `string` 

This option will change the name of the row object classes or placeholder. 
Remember that if you change this value you have to use this as base for row placeholder:

```scss
$row-name: foo;
.row {
	@extend %foo
}
```

### $column-name
default: `column` - type: `string` 

This option will change the name of the row object classes or placeholder. 
Remember that if you change this value you have to use this as base for row placeholder:

```scss
$row-name: bar;
.column {
	@extend %bar
}
```
### $grid-start
default: `left` - type: `string` //- possibile value: `left` or `right`

This is the value to change if you want to develop a rtl application.

### $use-dry
default: `true` - type: `boolean` 

In the **mixins section** you will find a `dry-it` mixin. If you don't want to use it set this variable to `false`.

### $debug
default: `false` - type: `boolean` 

With big applications and semantic BEM selectors, is difficult to understand what kind of properties we set to a determinate DOM element. If you set this variable `true`, we will generate a content property to the rules, that will be useful when we inspect the elements.

**Example:**

```css
.fooColumn {
  font-size: 30px; }
  @media only screen and (min-width: 45em) {
    .fooColumn {
      left: 8.33333%;
      right: 8.33333%;
      padding: 0 0.9375rem;
      -webkit-box-ordinal-group: 1;
      -webkit-order: 0;
          -ms-flex-order: 0;
              order: 0;
      content: "COLUMN: width : (xxsmall: 6, large: 6) | push : 1 | pull : 1 | order : 0 | global : true"; } }
```

<br/>

## Run it
You can simply import `main.sass` in your project, or you can run our tasks to deploy your custom css file. You can use:


`$ npm run dev` -> Compile sources, serve the dev folder and start watchers

`$ npm run compile` -> Compile the sources for development

`$ npm run build` -> Compile for distribution
